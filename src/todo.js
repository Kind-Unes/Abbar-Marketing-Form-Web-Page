/**
 * Replace boring icons with Lottie animations from LottieFiles or similar free networks
Connect contact form with Supabase backend
Add a unique About Us section
Make grid/dotted background clearer (but not too much)
Add subpages with routes:

/projects
/services (with sub-routes like /services/mobile, /services/web, etc.)
/about
/privacy-policy
/contact
/faq
/terms
/team
/jobs


Remove blog references
Connect all footer links and buttons to corresponding routes
Use Lottie or free animation services creatively in subpages

This is a major undertaking. I'll need to:

Convert the single-page app to a multi-page React Router app
Create all the subpages
Add Lottie animations using @lottiefiles/react-lottie-player or lottie-react
Set up Supabase connection for the contact form
Update navigation and footer links


all code must be in a single file
